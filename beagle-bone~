Pair a new device

Provided we already had installed the bluez Install bluez package we will be able to pair a device from the command line with bluez-simple-agent:

bluez-simple-agent hci# xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx

Replace # with the Bluetooth adapter number (e.g. hci0) and xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx with the MAC of our Bluetooth device.

    To get the number of our adapter we may issue:

    hciconfig

    The MAC of devices can be scanned for with the following command:

    hcitool scan

The Bluetooth device should be in pairing mode of course. Enter the pin code when asked to pair the device.
Remove a paired device

If we already had paired a device and need to remove it from the database (e.g. for re-pairing) we may do so with

bluez-simple-agent hci# xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx remove


Code:
#sudo apt-get install bluez

libbluetooth3 will also be installed.

Code:
#sudo apt-get install python-gobject python-dbus
Code:
#cd  /usr/share/doc/bluez/examples/
Code:
#sudo ./simple-agent hci0 XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX

Press the reset or pair button on your keyboard, simple-agent will ask to specify a pin like 1111, then type that pin on the bt keyboard and your bt keyboard is paired.

Code:
#sudo ./test-device trusted XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX yes
Code:
#sudo /etc/init.d/bluetooth restart
